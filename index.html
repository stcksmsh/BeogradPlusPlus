                            BeogradPlusPlus is an android app made to point out a serious flaw which existed in the city of
                            Belgrades public transport payment system. 
                            The system worked by the riders sending messages to the number '9011' which contained the ticket type
                            they wished to purchase, and then they would receive a confirmation message, containing a ticket number
                            if the payment was successful. This pattern of messages was easy to fake as there was really no 
                            feasable way to check whether someone had actually purchased a ticket, 
                            because there was (at the time) no central database through the use of which ticket
                            number could be cross checked. Someone riding the various busses and trams throughout the city could simply
                            use an app like this, or text a friend whom they saved in their contacts as '9011'.
                            The problem has been fixed as of October 2023, but this app serves as a testament to poor software
                            security which happens every day.
